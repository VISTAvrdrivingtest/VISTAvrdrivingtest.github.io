<b>Abstract:</b> 
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Virtual reality (VR) is a powerful yet underutilized tool for understanding human behavior in context of autonomous driving.
Often user studies are used in evaluation of the outputs of proposed methods or systems.  In contrast, in this work we examine the possibility of using study results 
conducted in a VR system for data generation to model human behaviors. Autonomous driving, at its core, involves 3D interaction with humans both as users and as actors in the environment. Today, there is little in autonomous driving research that explores human studies in VR as an avenue of data collection and behavioral understanding. 
In this paper, we combine systematic practices for VR user studies with knowledge of key problems from autonomous driving research to standardize and establish guidelines in VR-based user studies for autonomous driving.

Average velocity of traffic flow over time for each of the 26 CARLA Leaderboard Test Scenarios.
We show the traffic flow of LBC (baseline) versus our method for each of the 26 Test Scenarios over 1000 timesteps. For most scenarios, with the exception of scenarios 8, 16, and 22, our method improves the local traffic flow by increasing average velocity.  -->
